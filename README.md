# ilwasm
Maps a subset of [.NET CIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Intermediate_Language) to WebAssembly S-expressions. Implemented as a custom code generator backend for the [JSIL](https://github.com/sq/JSIL) CIL -> JS compiler.

## Building on Windows
Make sure you have Visual Studio 2015 (the free Community edition is fine). Build JSIL (```third_party/JSIL/JSIL.sln```), then build WasmSExprEmitter & WasmMeta (```WasmSExprEmitter.sln```).

## Building on Linux
A recent version of Mono is required for C#6 support and NuGet compatibility. If you don't have a recent version of Mono installed, run ```third_party/JSIL/install-mono.sh``` once to download & build from source, then do ```source third_party/JSIL/activate-mono.sh``` to load it into your current environment.

Build JSIL (```third_party/JSIL/linux-build.sh```), then build WasmSExprEmitter & WasmMeta (```linux-build.sh```).

## Writing tests
Tests are placed in the ```third_party/tests``` directory as .cs files. A test has a single entry point (typically ```Program.Main```) that accepts no arguments and has no return value.

The entry point's body must contain only calls to APIs from ```Wasm.Test```, like ```SetHeapSize``` or ```AssertEq```. Constants are fine but locals, branching or other behavior are not allowed in the entry point, as it is converted into top-level wasm assertions.

For more sophisticated tests, ```AssertHeapEq``` and ```AssertHeapEqFile``` can be used to assert against the contents of the wasm heap. ```AssertHeapEqFile``` will produce the actual contents of the heap as a file in the ```output``` directory during test runs, for debugging.

### Exports

A test can export static methods with the Wasm.Module.Export attribute, like so:
```csharp
[Export]
public static void Exported () {}
[Export("customName")]
public static void AlsoExported () {}
```
Exported methods can be invoked by name in the entry point by using the ```Test.AssertEq``` and ```Test.Invoke``` APIs.

### Heap

Tests requiring access to the heap must first reserve it using the ```Test.SetHeapSize``` API. To read/write the heap use the fields of the ```Wasm.Heap``` class, like so:
```csharp
Wasm.Heap.I32[offset] = value;
value = Wasm.Heap.U8[@base, offset];
```

The heap is not accessible externally (i.e. in the entry point) so to perform assertions against heap data, you must expose the heap via an exported function.

You can get the base of the heap as a pointer using the Base property of the heap fields, i.e. ```Wasm.Heap.I32.Base```.

### Fields and properties

Static fields of supported types work. To access a field's value from outside, export accessor methods, or simply define it as an exported property:
```csharp
[Export]
public static int Property { get; set; }
```

### Types

Currently only integral and floating-point types are supported. Functions and variables of other types will be ignored (or outright rejected) by ilwasm.

### Future features

* Struct fields
* Struct locals
* ref/out parameters
